# pyPomodoro
needed a bell for the end of a pomodoro timer so I built mine

# setup 
this is a terminal based tool, you have to run it in a console 

### tip
I added an alias to start the program from everywhere
```alias youraliasname="cd path/pyPomodoro/; python main.py"```
## python
This was made under python 3.10 

## libs 
[pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) 
[time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)

## use 
you will have a french prompt to select a task (focus - 25min by default, short break - 5min, long break - 12min)
after the time you will be informed by a sound, then the prompt will appear again (and show you the differents cycles you already completed)

## stop
you can leave the program by killing the signal with ```ctrl + c```
